### from Emma: 
I have a lot of good memories of growing up and most of them revolve around the whole family getting together.

The post Christmas get together at your house was always something I looked forward to, thank you for putting up with the chaos we all brought when together in one place.

### from Trisha:
Happy 60th Birthday Auntie Karen. Thanks for all the walks to Elvaston Castle and trips to the beach as a young child... Some of my favourite memories.
