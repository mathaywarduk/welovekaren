Thanks Mum for always being there whenever I've fucked up my life! Your help and advice over the years has got me back on track and happier than I've ever been.

Everyone says I'm exactly like my Dad but I like to think I get my better qualities from you. You're the kindest and most loving person I know, which is why most of James' friends still come to you for advice!

The way you have managed to drag up both James and I into the awesome adult male role models that we are, while also studying for and achieving your fellowship and making sandwiches for a 50+ year-old man who can't butter bread is beyond inspirational.

You deserve a medal, but unfortunately we just made you a website instead!
