Karen, you are beautiful, adorable and caring and I still can't believe you married me some 38 odd years ago.

You are the love of my life and I am so happy and proud to call you my wife.

Birthdays come and birthdays go, but this is a biggie, and you're going to have an amazing birthday week, wait and see, you deserve it!

Happy Birthday Darling
