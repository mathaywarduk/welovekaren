I love you, probably more than you could know!

Thank you for making me who I am today (and yes, you are responsible for the good and the bad!). You worked so hard to make our life wonderful, and definitely succeeded.

To this day, you are my moral compass and conscience - much to my annoyance I still can't do things that I know you wouldn't want me to do. I still don't own a motorbike!
