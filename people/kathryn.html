Happy 60th Birthday Karen!

You are such a great friend despite the distance! Genuine, caring, honest, funny and supportive but not a line or wrinkle on your forehead - that's just not bloody fair!!!

Have a great party Karen, relax and enjoy - you deserve it!!

Lots of love from Kathryn, Bryan, Joah & Aimee xxxx
