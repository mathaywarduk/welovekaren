My knitting buddy (promise I'll make something other than a scarf one day!)

My favourite thing is how you always greet us with a big smile no matter what day or time it is. It's like walking into a big hug.

I love our garden chill times, cosy sofa natters and uncontrollable giggles at silly things.

Thanks for the unconditional support, advice and cheesy beans on toast!

You're the best Mother-in-law I could ever have.
